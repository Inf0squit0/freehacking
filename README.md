## A note about hardware

Other than password cracking and some niche cases involving virtual machines (see an example below), hacking doesn't actually require high-end hardware - a laptop with 16GB of RAM and integrated graphics will work just fine. A laptop with 32GB of RAM and integrated graphics will last you a very long time, especially if you install Linux on it. If you want a dedicated hacking and/or Linux laptop, buy a Thinkpad or Dell Latitude with 16GB of RAM or more off of ebay. Last time I checked you can get a decent laptop that can run Linux and do most hacking things for a few hundred dollars USD. If you're going to be learning hacking from your daily use Windows or Mac laptop, 16-32GB of RAM should still be fine. 

If you're really getting into this and want to explore more advanced topics like Active Directory attacks, then you might want to make sure you have a computer with 32-64GB of RAM to run multiple virtual machines like the full GOAD lab, but that's optional, especially if you're just getting started and/or limited by budget considerations. You could still easily find a laptop capable of running Linux and the full GOAD lab for $500 USD, possibly less, as long as you're willing to install Linux on a laptop yourself.
